# v5.0.0

## helmet config incompatibility

In Magda v5, we upgraded [helmet](https://github.com/helmetjs/helmet) to v8.0.0.
Please check document:

- https://github.com/helmetjs/helmet?tab=readme-ov-file#reference
- https://github.com/magda-io/magda/blob/cbcb9ba383d0490aa9a42abaf81f3532681a9c8e/deploy/helm/internal-charts/gateway/values.yaml#L179

to upgrade your helm chart config.

> Incorrect helmet config may cause gateway fail to start. If it happens, please check gateway logs for reason.
